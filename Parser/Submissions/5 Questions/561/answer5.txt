im skipping the scanner importation and class making. My scanner is called "in";

int year = Math.random()*27+1990;
int month=Math.random()*12;
int day= Math.random()*30;

do{  system.out.print("Guess the date between 1990 and 2017");
int yearq =in.nextInt();
int monthq=in.nextInt();
int dayq=in.nextInt();

if(yearq>year){system.out.print("Wrong, Too late"); continue;}
if(yearq<year){system.out.print("Wrong, Too early");  continue;}

if(monthq>month){system.out.print("Wrong too late"); continue;}
if(monthq<month){system.out.print("Wrong too early"); continue;}

if(dayq>day){system.out.print("Wrong too late"); continue;}
if(dayq<day){system.out.print("Wrong too early"); continue;}

break;}while (1>2)

system.out.print("You did it awsome!");}



//it made more sense to allow the user more trys to guess it so i made it so that they would have to guess untill they were correct.
